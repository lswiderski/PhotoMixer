Finalizing the installation
===========================
  - Some version of Visual studio may not find the references to the Nokia Imaging SDK that were added to your project by NuGet.  To fix things, simply close your project and reopen it. 
  - Make sure that your project doesn't have "Any CPU" as an "Active solution platform". You will find the instructions how to do this here: http://developer.nokia.com/resources/library/Lumia/nokia-imaging-sdk/adding-libraries-to-the-project.html

New in SDK 1.1
==============

Windows 8.1 support

Since the Nokia Lumia family now includes a Windows RT 8.1 tablet, the Lumia 2520, we ported the library to the "big windows" platform. 


Foreground Segmenter

The new version of the SDK adds a filter API for picking the foreground/background from an image. Developers can use this component to create a UI where users tap, swipe, or point at the object boundaries and the API will figure out which objects belong to foreground and vice versa. This is often used for, for example, background swap or blurring the background with Bokeh.


Get Bokeh'd

A new effect, Lens Blur, also known as Bokeh, is a digital recreation of the familiar Bokeh effect so often used in professional photography. The Nokia Imaging SDK makes applying the new Bokeh effect or blending with mask quick and easy.


HDR effect

A new effect that can be applied to an image to create stunning and vibrant photorealistic color effects similar to HDR, or with more conservative settings, auto enhance the image colors.
